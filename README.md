This is an alpha version. This software was used to perform the analyses in:
>Gaiarsa S, Bitar I, Comandatore F, et al. Can Insertion Sequences Proliferation Influence Genomic Plasticity? Comparative Analysis of Acinetobacter baumannii Sequence Type 78, a Persistent Clone in Italian Hospitals. Front Microbiol. 2019;10:2080 doi:10.3389/fmicb.2019.02080

#### Briefly
Detects genes interrupted by Insertion Sequences in bacterial genomes using short reads

required inputs are:
- A pangenome of the species/of the input samples
- The sequences of query IS. They can be obtained from the ISFinder website
